# C++ Display and Calculate Interest Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This program displays and calculates the interest gained from an investment given initial value, monthly deposit, interest rate, and number of years.

# What did you do particularly well?
I was able to comparmentalize the program with a class that implemented the required functions, this allowed for the main program to be concise and easy to understand.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would enhance the code by adding input validation. This would make the code secure since it would be less prone to crash from a user entering an unexpected input.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging piece of the code was outputting the correct white space, and I was able to overcome this by creating a function that outputted a header used throughout the program. I will be using functions more in order to divide big outputs into smaller ones which should be easier to manage.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I did not know how to write code in seperate files before, I now have a good understanding of how this works which should be very helpful for other projects.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable by making a class with various functions, readable by adding inline comments, and adaptable by keeping main as simple as possible.
